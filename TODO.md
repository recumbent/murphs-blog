Things I want to do to move the blog forward

[ ] Review of folder structure - can I leave it alone now? Point here is to be able to have cannonical links and things and to avoid having to worry about redirects. Yet.  
[ ] RSS Feed so that anyone who is foolish enough to want to subscribe can  
[ ] Site index file, not that I want to be googled, but it does like that sort of Things  
[ ] Proper attribution link for the banner image  
[ ] Better home / landing page (most recent article, link to previous)  
[ ] Next / Previous links  
[ ] Tags index  
[ ] More comprehensive about page
[ ] Make sure I've got enough attributions and things
[ ] Make sure I've got the right license etc
[ ] Nicer lists of things - in particular links from article titles to tags etc
[ ] Proper (or at least better) handling of blog post series
[ ] More / better styling - deal with the simple problems, look at how to deal with the complicated problems
